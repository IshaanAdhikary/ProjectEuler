We only have to search numbers with up to seven digits, as n * 9! (The theoretical maximum factorial total for an n digit number) where n = 8 is the first value where the factorial total does not have n digits, meaning that any factorial total will be invalid.
To search every possible combination of digits without repeats, we can go over every digit in order where each digit is either equal to or less than the last digit. Since there is only one way for any set of numbers to be ordered this way, and every set of numbers will be generated at some point, this process will search every combination without searching every number, since searching every number would be redundant; if 145 is valid, then 415 will never be valid, since both will have the same factorial sum.
Each set of digits also includes multiple amounts of digits; 3 digits, 4 digits, 9 digits, etc.
For each combination of digits, we find the factorial sum. Then we compare the amount of each digit for the sum and the original set of digits; if they are the same, the number is valid, and is added to the total. The total result is our answer.
