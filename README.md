# ProjectEuler

My code for answering Project Euler problems! I did the first ~25 problems or so without organizing them, but then started coding them on Github.
In each folder is a Java project along with a (hopefully) brief explanation on what the code is doing, and how it's solving the problem.
Most code will be in Java or C#, but I may change it depending on whatever language I'm using most at the time.
